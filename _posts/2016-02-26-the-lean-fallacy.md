The myth that speed leads to better results in digital product creation is one the “lean startup movement” and their followers like to promote.

While shortening the feedback loop, in an ideal world, helps combat scope creep and endless internal iteration without reality checks, the truth is that the gospel of speed will eventually lead the organization down the rabbit hole that results in **expedience**: which is, choosing the hastiest way of doing something.

I think it’s wise to think a little deeper. Not simply adopting the latest way of doing things, but understanding why. The *why* behind the Lean movement is one of learning. When you have an early product and a really small team of smart people, early and frequent releases can boost your learning.

The truth is that if your team doesn’t consist solely of people who can both build products very well and also understand the human and business contexts behind the “metrics” you receive, trying to shorten your release cycles merely slows you down.

Mostly, it slows you down when you do things that don't result in any learning, and then you have to circle back to fix the debt you racked up.

This is the chief reason why lean startups with a sales-based CEO and an “agile” entry-level dev team crash and burn before they can scale, and is the opposite of the Analysis Paralysis effect, which the Lean movement was trying to combat.

In summary, while I don’t think that the Lean movement is without merit,  the number of teams it’ll actually help is far less than you’d think, and unless you have complete autonomy over both your business and your product, it’s wiser to go with our old friend, Waterfall. 

With a battle-tested external team and lots and lots of testing, you can go very far. If you can’t integrate tech and business very well (i.e., you’re a business owner who doesn’t know how to code), you’d be wise to separate church and state and play to your strengths. Whatever you do, remember this: do not micromanage.
