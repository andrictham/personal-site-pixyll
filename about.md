### Heya!

I’m curious by nature (admittedly a bit of a dilettante). I like observing the world, reading up on new subjects, and in general learning more about the world.

I’ve been a “webmaster” running my own websites since I was a wee sprout at 13 years. Since 2015, I’ve made the transition to the field of User Experience Designer, where I create digital products to address human needs.

### I write, sometimes.
